## About Me
I am a **Research Specialist** in the **Jacobs-Wagner Lab** at **Stanford University**. My research integrates **high-content imaging** with **big-data analysis** to understand how cellular functions, homeostasis, and phenotypic variability emerge from the physical interactions between biologically significant components, the scaling of growth constituents, and the biosynthetic gating of cell cycle processes. 

## Open access
I am guided by my vision for an openly accessible, ethical science that addresses contemporary biomedical and environmental challenges while expanding our quantitative understanding of fundamental biological processes.
